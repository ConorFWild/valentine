# valentine



Happy Valentine's day Sophia!

So, I thought what could be kind of cool is if I made you a little game, and commented the code thorougly, so it could be both a bit of fun to play and also, at least maybe, showcase some cool ideas you could use in your own game coding! 

Something that I thought I could do that might be a bit funky is emphasise a functional style of programming! There are no "traditional" classes with mutable state in this game! Every time an object would change state a new object is created to replace it ^^

In order to play this little game I made for you, all you need to do is:

```
pip install pandas
pip install xlrd
pip install openpyxl
python cafe.py
```

I hope you have fun! 

Love, Conor
